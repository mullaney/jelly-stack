What is Jelly Stack? It's a super fast way to create a website. Edit the markdown, run '**npm run build**' and copy the contents of the dist folder to a webserver. You can automate the process using services like github pages or netlify to deploy in seconds.

Check out the [repo on github](https://github.com/mullaney/jelly-stack).

See the built site at [jelly-stack.netlify.app](https://jelly-stack.netlify.app/).
