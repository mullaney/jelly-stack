Jelly Stack was made by Kevin "Mullaney" Kelly. I work as a software engineer in Chicago. I have developing this as a side project. Please consider it a work in progress. However, if you have questions about this repo or need help, please open an issue at the [github repo for this application](https://github.com/mullaney/jelly-stack/issues). If you would like to contact me about something else, you may email me at kvinklly@gmail.com. Please follow me on twitter at [@kvinklly](https://twitter.com/kvinklly).
