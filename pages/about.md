# About Jelly Stack

Jelly Stack is a simple JavaScript build engine, which takes markdwon, CSS, and image files, and builds static html sites. You add pages by adding markdown files in the pages directory. Add styles by editing the existin CSS files, or adding your own.

When you are ready, you can build your site with:

```
npm run build
```

And publish your build using github pages, netlify or the hosting company of your choice. The resulting files should load fast. Check back for instructions on how to setup your site with continuous deployment and one of these services.
